# Frogger Game
This is the first big project that I have completed. It is a grid-based game developed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, modelled on Frogger with a Lord of the Rings theme. In place of a frog, the user will control Frodo and the objective is to navigate him up the grid to Mount Doom using keyboard inputs. The player must avoid enemies that can kill Frodo, resulting in the loss of one of three lives and eventual defeat. Additionally, a thirty-second countdown timer adds to the challenge, ending in defeat if it should reach zero.

## Planning
During planning, I first divided the project into different stages, each with specific objectives. 
Initially, I spent time planning by creating a wireframe to outline the desired game functionalities and initial thoughts on styling. I then spent the time we had over the holiday researching how to implement these and updating my wireframe. 
I allocated a large portion of time to focussing on the fundamental features and basic styling to ensure I had a working game by the project end. However, implementing some of the features I had planned proved more challenging than anticipated given the timeline and I had to revise my initial plan. Towards the end of the project timeline, I had an opportunity to incorporate stretch goals such as the lives system and timer. Additionally, I focused on further refining the styling to fully realise the Lord of the Rings theme.


After deciding on creating a Lord of the Rings Frogger game, I began planning by considering the game's features and functionality, as well as the styling. To accomplish this, I created a wireframe using Excalidraw. I carefully thought about the various elements I intended to include in the game and the corresponding logic required to implement each feature. Although some aspects were challenging to fully understand during the planning stage, I was able to include them with ongoing research and trial and error during the coding phase.
